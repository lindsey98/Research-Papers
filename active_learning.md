## membership query synthesis

*generate new samples(adversarial attacks, maybe)*

## stream-based selective sampling

*whether a sample should be queried or not*

##  pool-based selective sampling

*choose samples from an unlabeled pool*

- random sampling

### uncertainty based

- least confident

- entropy

- margin sampling(?
